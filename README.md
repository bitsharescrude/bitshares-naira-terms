6. Orders and Service Fees
a. Orders
Upon placing an Order to effect a trade using the Services (an “Order”), XBITS Account will be updated to reflect the open Order (as HTLC) and your Order will be included in Bitshares blockchain (https://wallet.bitshares.org/#/explorer/blocks) The history of all HTLC transactions can be found in the Bitshares blockchain blockexplorer https://bts.ai/htlcs . once your deposit is confirmed, the Services will execute an exchange (a “Transfer”). Upon execution of the Transfer, your Account will be updated to reflect the deposit and the Order will be closed.

b. Tellers
XBITS is basically equivalent to a HTLC teller whose aim is to process HTLC transactions on the blockchain to be able to redeem your digital assets. XBITS will only process transactions related to XBITS.ASSETS. These assets are backed 100% by the real NGN(for fiat), BTC or ETH or any other digital assets that people use. XBITS.ASSETS is thus in theory equivalent to the BTC you get on Poloniex, which could be prefixed POLO.BTC. In both cases you rely on the service provider, CCEDK for XBITS. assets and Poloniex for POLO. assets, to remain solvent in order to back the value of the assets they've issued.
